Input Fields allow users to enter data into the application in different formats.


# States
Input text form fields have multiple states: default, hover, pressed, and disabled. Different states help the user to navigate through the fields and know what information is still needed.

While error messages are the most common, success messages are also used occasionally. Success, warning and error messages are are available to use.
