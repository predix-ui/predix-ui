# Q4 2017 Release

## Polymer 2.x Upgrade
Almost all\*\* of the Predix Design System components have been upgraded to be Polymer 1.x/2.x [hybrid elements](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/hybrid-elements), meaning they can be used with either Polymer version.

\*\* The only component not upgraded to Polymer 2.x hybrid is the px-data-table, which will be replaced with a more feature-rich component based on the Vaadin grid. The new grid, which is being built entirely in Polymer 2.x, is expected to be released in Q1 of 2018. Since this site now runs on Polymer 2, you may see a broken demo for px-data-table, but you can still access it in a standalone fashion [here](https://www.predix-ui.com/px-data-table/px-data-table/).

Benefits of upgrading to Polymer 2.x include:
* Better inter-operability for the Angular, React and Vue frameworks
* Better performance in browsers with native support for web components
* Better performance of the components, as we can use features not available in Polymer 1.x
* Ongoing Google support of Polymer 2.x (bug fixes, etc)

The syntax of light DOM content distribution slots has changed in Polymer 2.0, resulting in the following **API breaking changes / major version bumps**. In the previous version, for instance, you may have passed an action button into a Card with `class="actions"` but now you should use `slot="actions"` instead. Refer to the API of each component for more details and example code.

Impacted components:
* [Card](/#/modules/px-card) (v2)
* [Modal](/#/modules/px-modal) (v3)
* [View Header](/#/modules/px-view-header) (v2)
* [Widget Cards](/#/modules/px-widget-cards) (v4)


## Features & Enhancements

* [Card](/#/modules/px-card) - in addition to the above API change, all of the view service related behaviors (card/dealer/dashboard) were deprecated
* [Context Browser](/#/modules/px-context-browser) - added the ability to set "favorites" for quicker access
* Data Visualization
  * added flexible API for creating and interacting with chart annotations (see [developer guide](/#/develop/vis/annotations))
  * added single point search option
  * added lasso functionality for selection of points
  * the web worker is now a blob, you no longer need to include the files in your build process
* [Date/Time Refactoring](/#/develop/datetime-changes)
* [Dropdown](/#/modules/px-dropdown) - slot added so that any arbitrary element can be used as the dropdown trigger
* [Inbox](/#/modules/px-inbox) - property added to make referencing the selected item easier; removed dependency on moment.js
* [Modal](/#/modules/px-modal) - simplified trigger/modal relationship and configuration of positive/negative action buttons
* [Tile](/#/modules/px-tile) - updated visual design, new property for text that appears on the bottom of tile vs on hover
