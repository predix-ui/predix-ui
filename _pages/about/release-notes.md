# Q4 2017 Release

## Polymer 2.x Upgrade
Almost all\*\* of the Predix Design System components have been upgraded to be Polymer 1.x/2.x [hybrid elements](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/hybrid-elements), meaning they can be used with either Polymer version.

\*\* The only component not upgraded to Polymer 2.x hybrid is the px-data-table, which will be replaced with a more feature-rich component based on the Vaadin grid. The new grid, which is being built entirely in Polymer 2.x, is expected to be released in mid-January of 2018. Since this site now runs on Polymer 2, you may see a broken demo for px-data-table, but you can still access it in a standalone fashion [here](https://www.predix-ui.com/px-data-table/px-data-table/).

Benefits of upgrading to Polymer 2.x include:
* Better inter-operability for the Angular, React and Vue frameworks
* Better performance in browsers with native support for web components
* Better performance of the components, as we can use features not available in Polymer 1.x
* Ongoing Google support of Polymer 2.x (bug fixes, etc)

The syntax of light DOM content distribution slots has changed in Polymer 2.0, resulting in the following **API breaking changes / major version bumps**. In the previous version, for instance, you may have passed an action button into a Card with `class="actions"` but now you should use `slot="actions"` instead. Refer to the API of each component for more details and example code.

Impacted components:
* [Card](/#/modules/px-card) (v2)
* [Modal](/#/modules/px-modal) (v3)
* [View Header](/#/modules/px-view-header) (v2)
* [Widget Cards](/#/modules/px-widget-cards) (v4)


## Features & Enhancements

* [Card](/#/modules/px-card) - in addition to the above API change, all of the view service related behaviors (card/dealer/dashboard) were deprecated
* [Context Browser](/#/modules/px-context-browser) - added the ability to set "favorites" for quicker access
* Data Visualization
  * added flexible API for creating and interacting with chart annotations **(Developer Guide coming soon)**
  * added single point search option
  * added lasso functionality for selection of points
  * the web worker is now a blob, you no longer need to include the files in your build process
* Date/Time Refactoring
  * all date/time components now support an empty state, where no date or range has been selected
  * property added for "required" date/time fields, validation will fail if they are not completed
  * string-typed properties for `dateTime` and `range` have been removed; this fixes several bugs related to syncing issues between the Moment objects and their corresponding strings, and means that the highly flexible Moment object is the sole source of truth
* [Dropdown](/#/modules/px-dropdown) - slot added so that any arbitrary element can be used as the dropdown trigger
* [Inbox](/#/modules/px-inbox) - property added to make referencing the selected item easier; removed dependency on moment.js
* [Modal](/#/modules/px-modal) - simplified trigger/modal relationship and configuration of positive/negative action buttons
* [Tile](/#/modules/px-tile) - updated visual design, new property for text that appears on the bottom of tile vs on hover


# Q3 2017 Release

## Features & Enhancements

* Data Visualization Updates
  * [Radar](/#/modules/px-vis-radar), [Parallel Coordinates](/#/modules/px-vis-parallel-coordinates), and [Polar](/#/modules/px-vis-polar) charts - added the ability to zoom in/out
  * [Tooltip](/#/elements/vis/px-vis/px-vis-tooltip) - added option for event name in tooltips
  * [Toolbar](/#/elements/vis/px-vis/px-vis-toolbar) - added the ability to customize placement of toolbar sub-menu
* [Icon Set](/#/modules/px-icon-set) - expanded the set of icons to nearly 200
* [Map](/#/modules/px-map) - extended px-map-marker to allow custom colors and types

## New Components

* [Chip](/#/modules/px-chip) - represents a small piece of information, such as a contact or filter, with an optional toggle
* [Heatmap Grid](/#/modules/px-heatmap-grid) - displays a data set in a grid layout with a color scale based on the values
* [Panel](/#/modules/px-panel) - container for placement of controls or content; can be fixed or relative, and persistent or shown/hidden
* [Steps](/#/modules/px-steps) - shows a sequence of steps and progress made - useful for wizards, multi-step forms, etc
* [Tile](/#/modules/px-tile) - displays an image with accompanying text, with two different states and an animation on hover or mobile tap

## Site improvements on predix-ui.com

* [Component gallery](/#/gallery) with visual previews and filtering of design patterns and components
* Added new development and design guidelines
* Component code snippets can be expanded & collapsed
* Icons added to indicate suitability of components for use on mobile/tablet/desktop

## FAQ

### Q: Why release a new aesthetic to the Predix Design System?
A: The previous Predix Design System was over 2 years old. Based on learnings and feedback from our users, we were excited to collaborate with our community to release a more contemporary and sophisticated visual style.

### Q: I’m using a pre-Cirrus Predix UI component, can I still use this version and make a fix or enhancement to it myself?
A: Yes you can but you should also make the fix/enhancement in the Cirrus version of the component.

### Q: I need the Predix UI team to make an enhancement to a component or chart. Can you do this on the pre-Cirrus component?
A: No. We are maintaining and enhancing only the Cirrus version of the components going forward. Please contact the Predix UI team if there is an urgent business case for your request.

### Q: Can I take one of the Cirrus components or charts without upgrading all of my components?
A: No. There are dependencies between components, so this is not recommended. You should upgrade your app to be in sync and have a harmonious user experience.

### Q: I have other non-Predix UI components mixed in with Predix UI components in my application, how do I apply Cirrus to these?
A: There are Design Guidelines to help your designers to redesign these components and Predix UI designers have internal office hours to support.

### Q: I have a need for a design that is not part of the Predix Design System? How can I get this included?
A: We love contributions back to the Predix Design System. Please contact the Predix UI team to discuss the proposed contribution.
