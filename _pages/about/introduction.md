The Predix Design System makes it easy to create powerful, user-friendly web applications with components built to withstand the demand of industrial use cases. The system is made up of three parts:

* plug-and-play **Predix UI Components** that speed UI/UX development
* composable and reusable **CSS modules** that establish consistent design
* extensive **stencils and guidelines** to guide your application design

Used together, these tools help teams jumpstart the creation of Industrial Internet web applications running on top of [Predix services](https://docs.predix.io/en/service) and data.

## Supported browsers

# Predix UI Components

Predix UI Components are a set of user interface building blocks based on the [W3C web components standard](https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/components#w3c_all) that can be quickly assembled together to build an application. Components are available for a wide range UI elements such as drop down menus, data tables and tabs as well more specialized D3-based data visualization charting components designed specifically for industrial internet use cases.

The components are framework agnostic and can fit into many existing JavaScript web applications such as Angular, React or Ember. [Google's Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) provides innovative "syntactic sugar" and polyfill libraries for practical adoption of modern web components. Polymer helps build web applications with custom, encapsulated, reusable components that work just like HTML elements.

# CSS Modules

The second part of the Design System is a set of CSS modules written in Sass using the powerful BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) and OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS) code patterns, ensuring your CSS codebase can grow quickly and still be easy to maintain.

Components consume the CSS, but you can also choose to use the CSS independently to create the base typography, layout, and content design of your application. [The CSS starter kit has everything you need to get going.](/#/css/px-starter-kit-design)

# Design Starter Kit & Design Guidelines

Finally, [the Design Starter Kit](https://github.com/predixdesignsystem/predix-design-stencil) combined with the design guidelines provide the tools to start the design process off in the right direction. The Starter Kit is a Sketch file that contains the most common layouts and components and themes in a flexible, ready to use format. The guidelines are documented best practices and assist designers and developers in making key decisions about an applications design.
