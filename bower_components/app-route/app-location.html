`app-location` is an element that provides synchronization between the
browser location bar and the state of an app. When created, `app-location`
elements will automatically watch the global location for changes. As changes
occur, `app-location` produces and updates an object called `route`. This
`route` object is suitable for passing into a `app-route`, and other similar
elements.

An example of the public API of a route object that describes the URL
`https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-location`:

    {
      prefix: '',
      path: '/elements/app-location'
    }

Example Usage:

    <app-location route="{{route}}"></app-location>
    <app-route route="{{route}}" pattern="/:page" data="{{data}}"></app-route>

As you can see above, the `app-location` element produces a `route` and that
property is then bound into the `app-route` element. The bindings are two-
directional, so when changes to the `route` object occur within `app-route`,
they automatically reflect back to the global location.

### Hashes vs Paths

By default `app-location` routes using the pathname portion of the URL. This has
broad browser support but it does require cooperation of the backend server. An
`app-location` can be configured to use the hash part of a URL instead using
the `use-hash-as-path` attribute, like so:

    <app-location route="{{route}}" use-hash-as-path></app-location>

### Integrating with other routing code

There is no standard event that is fired when window.location is modified.
`app-location` fires a `location-changed` event on `window` when it updates the
location. It also listens for that same event, and re-reads the URL when it's
fired. This makes it very easy to interop with other routing code.

So for example if you want to navigate to `/new_path` imperatively you could
call `window.location.pushState` or `window.location.replaceState` followed by
firing a `location-changed` event on `window`. i.e.

    window.history.pushState({}, null, '/new_path');
    window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('location-changed'));
